## __Workflow__

If you decide to help out, we are very happy, as every character counts! For further information on how to contribute, please look at the points below.

1. Write me your github username on [discord](https://discordid.netlify.app/?id=250351201923629058) to get access to upload files into this repository.
2. Write into the [excel document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aAt00LrzuwAo22To2NgMUlkcVN71owEfSMqBlsPlnag/edit#gid=686614865) what file/text you want to translate
3. Update your progress

I personally use VisualStudioCode, where I open up the md file and translate it in there. But you are free to work with any other method you want. Just make sure keep the formatting and the edited name of the file.

__I strongly recommend uploading your progress into the repository, because other can view it and might find errors they can fix. It is also useful to ask for advice!__

## __Excel Usage__

Please enter your name into the excel document next to an empty table. Please consider logging the characters in there, as it shows your progress and helps other estime the remaining work to do. The same goes for showing which file you are translating (and coloring it). You can get a rough estimate of the character count with a [texthooker page](https://learnjapanese.moe/texthooker.html).
 
The files can be found [here](https://github.com/shoui520/shoui520.github.io/tree/master/docs).

### __Things to look out for__

__Terms like "immersion", "mining", and "to mine" are treated as loan words. These words shoudn't be translated, as it causes confusion and an unnatural feeling in german.__

- Immersion can be easily used in german as Immersion.
- Mining should be used as Mining in german, exmape:

> Mining means when you add vocabulary (often along with the sentence they were found in) into your Anki deck. ***eng ver.***

> Mining bedeutet, dass du Vokabeln (oft zusammen mit dem Satz, in dem sie vorkommen) zu deinem Anki-Deck hinzuf√ºgst. ***german translation***

The verb of mining is germanized. (Other ideas are greatly welcommed)

- Use punctuations as they occur
- Try to stay as close as possible to the original english
- Let is sound natural
- Acquisition = Aneignung
- If you don't have the required programm to change the english in pictures, let me know [here](https://discordid.netlify.app/?id=250351201923629058) 
- An additional `_de` should be added to each translated file name, exmaple index.md is the original file name and the transalted german version should be index_de.md accordingly.
